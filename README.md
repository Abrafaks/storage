Functionality:

I managed to finish Tier 1 of the challenge
I used nest_simple_auth to add possibility to create private directories.
Each "dropbox" endpoint is protected by Bearer Auth, and each user can manipulate on files and folders that belong only to him.

I've included postman collection to help test the API.
